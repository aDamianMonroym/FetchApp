# FetchApp
This GitHub repository hosts a predictive receipt counting application developed for Fetch's at-home exercise. The application is built using Python and Streamlit, with a backend that uses a custom machine learning model trained to forecast scanned receipt counts for different months. The app allows users to select a month and specify whether it's a weekend or not, and then it provides a prediction for the receipt count. The repository includes all the necessary codeA and datasets for running the app and deploying it via Streamlit.

Content:

1. This app runs with Python 3.11.0.
2. Two folders for images and the model.
3. To ensure data privacy for Fetch, I have not included the dataset.
4. A Jupyter notebook where I selected the best model for forecasting the receipts of 2022.
5. A requirements file containing all the necessary libraries for running the app.
6. A Dockerfile intended for containerizing the app (Note: I encountered BIOS-related issues preventing successful containerization).

 This code and app were developed by Angel Damian Monroy Mendoza. Please feel free to use it if it meets your needs :).
